Summer Analytics 2025 - Week 1 Assignment

Data Grand Prix! — My Submission

About the Project⚒️

This is my submission for the **Week 1 Assignment** of Summer Analytics 2025. 
The task involved exploring a cars dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Through this assignment, I practiced fundamental data analysis skills — from data loading and cleaning to filtering, aggregation, and visualization.

 What I Did💪

Imported necessary libraries to work with data efficiently.
Loaded the Cars dataset and explored its structure by checking its shape, columns, and unique values.
Manipulated the dataset by setting meaningful indices and creating new columns.
Answered analytical questions such as identifying cars with highest horsepower, counting cars by mpg criteria, and computing average acceleration by origin.
Visualized the data using line plots and scatterplots with clear labels and legends to illustrate trends like mpg evolution over years and car weight vs horsepower by origin.
Performed a consistency analysis to identify car models produced over multiple years with very low mpg variation, then reported their details sorted by frequency and mpg.

 Key Results💻

Found the **car with the highest horsepower**: *pontiac grand prix*.
Counted **36 cars with mpg ≥ 35**.
Determined **USA as the most common origin** for cars with horsepower > 100 and weight < 3000.
Calculated average acceleration of cars from Japan to be **16.17**.
Identified **1980 as the year with the highest average mpg**.
Created a **scatterplot of horsepower vs weight** colored by origin and sized by mpg.
Reported **consistent car models with mpg std deviation < 1.0** sorted by number of appearances and average mpg.



Final Thoughts

This assignment was a great way to solidify my skills in data manipulation and visualization. 
It was exciting to explore and extract insights from a real-world dataset while applying concepts learned so far in the Summer Analytics program.

Looking forward to tackling the next challenges ahead!
